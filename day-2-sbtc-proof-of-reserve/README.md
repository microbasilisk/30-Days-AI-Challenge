# sBTC Proof of Reserve Oracle

  **The Standard Security Layer for sBTC HODLMM Liquidity.**

  Provides real-time, trustless verification of sBTC backing via a 4-step Golden Chain:

  1. **Registry Sync** — fetch `aggregate-pubkey` from `sbtc-registry` (Stacks mainnet)
  2. **Taproot Derivation** — derive P2TR signer address via BIP-341 key tweak (no external lib)
  3. **L1 Reserve Audit** — query confirmed BTC balance at derived address via mempool.space
  4. **L2 Supply Audit** — query total circulating sBTC from `sbtc-token` contract

  ### HODLMM Safety Signal

  | Signal | Condition | Action |
  |--------|-----------|--------|
  | `GREEN` | reserve_ratio ≥ 0.999 | Safe to enter HODLMM bins |
  | `YELLOW` | reserve_ratio ≥ 0.995 | Hold — do not add liquidity |
  | `RED` | reserve_ratio < 0.995 | CRITICAL — exit bins immediately |
  | `DATA_UNAVAILABLE` | Fetch failed | Treat as RED |

  ### HODLMM Bonus Eligibility
  - Integrates Bitflow ticker API for live sBTC/pBTC price deviation
  - Exportable `runAudit()` — importable pre-flight check for any HODLMM agent
  - Pairs with [hodlmm-bin-guardian](https://github.com/BitflowFinance/bff-skills/pull/15#issuecomment-4139272430) as a complete two-skill security stack
  - Zero hardcoded values — all reserve data is live on-chain

  ### Verified on Mainnet
  - Signer address: `bc1p6ys2ervatu00766eeqfmverzegg9fkprn3xjn0ppn70h53qu5vus3yzl0x`
  - BTC reserve: 4,061.8 BTC | sBTC circulating: 4,061.8 sBTC | reserve_ratio: 1.0

  ## What it does
  Derives the sBTC signer's Bitcoin wallet address trustlessly from the Stacks `sbtc-registry` contract using BIP-341 Taproot key derivation, then verifies the live on-chain BTC reserve against total circulating sBTC supply. Outputs a GREEN/YELLOW/RED HODLMM
  safety signal that any agent can use as a pre-flight check before adding or managing liquidity in Bitflow HODLMM bins — preventing LP exposure to a de-pegged or under-collateralized asset.

  Security notes

  Fully read-only. No transactions, no on-chain writes, no fund movements. All data sourced from public APIs (Hiro, mempool.space, Bitflow, CoinGecko). Mainnet-only — no testnet support. Exit codes: 0 = healthy, 1 = warning, 2 = critical, 3 = error.

  Known constraints or edge cases

  - If CoinGecko rate-limits (>30 req/min on free tier), the price deviation component falls back gracefully but score may reflect stale data — peg_source will show unavailable
  - If sBTC/pBTC pool has no recent trades, falls back to sBTC/STX-derived price
  - reserve_ratio of exactly 1 is expected under normal conditions — sBTC is designed to be 1:1 backed
  - DATA_UNAVAILABLE is returned on any fetch failure — never a false GREEN signal
